<h1>Nature</h1>
<img src="jpg image.jpg" height="300" width="300">
<p>Nature encompasses all life, the physical environment, and natural phenomena not created by humans, serving as the
essential system that sustains all living beings by providing air, water, food, and climate regulation. It consists of
both living (plants, animals, humans) and non-living (water, land, atmosphere) elements that exist in an interdependent
web, maintaining ecosystems through a delicate balance that supports biodiversity and provides resources for human
survival and well-being.</p>

"A river is a natural, flowing stream of fresh water that moves from higher ground, through a channel with banks, and into a larger body of water like a lake, ocean, or another river. Rivers form from gravity-fed runoff from rain and melting snow, or from springs, and they shape the landscape by carving valleys and other features through erosion. </p>

Trees are indispensable for Earth's ecosystems and human well-being, providing essential functions such as producing
oxygen, absorbing carbon dioxide, preventing soil erosion, and regulating climate.
